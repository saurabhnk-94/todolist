# todolist

This is a fully functional TO DO list.

Anyone can add the items to the list.

This application has only frontend and works fine. 

Installation:

Clone this Repo:
```
https://github.com/saurabhnk-94/todolist.git
```
Get inside the todolist folder:
```
cd todolist
```
Start the application:
```
npm start
```

Using redux I have mainted my state in another folder. To check that implementation:
Get into to-do-list folder:
```
cd to-do-list
```
Start the application:
```
npm start
```

I hope you liked this application.
